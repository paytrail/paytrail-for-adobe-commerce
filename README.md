## Updating from Checkout Finland

`op-merchant-services/op-payment-service-for-magento-2` **module has been deprecated**. All of its functionality now exists as the rebranded Paytrail for Adobe Commerce module.

<b>Updating from that module requires manual installation.</b><br/>

<b>Warning! Removing `op-merchant-services/op-payment-service-for-magento-2` results in payments made with Checkout Finland not refundable through Magento Admin. Payments can still be refunded through
Paytrail’s Extranet.</b><br/>

1. Follow the installation instructions of `paytrail/paytrail-for-adobe-commerce`.
2. Navigate to Adobe Commerce admin interface and select __Stores -> Store Configuration -> Sales -> Payment Methods -> Checkout Finland__
3. Change __Enabled__ to __No__ to disable Checkout Finland payment method on checkout page

<b>Please note that the module configurations will not carry over from Checkout Finland to Paytrail for Adobe Commerce! 
You will need to save these values and reapply them yourself. This also applies to the Payment Page Personalization settings! 
<br/> Certain classes, functions and CSS classes have also been renamed and any third party customizations will have to be revised.</b><br/>

## Setting up Recurring Payments
The module now supports recurring payments. Please refer to [the full instructions on Recurring Payments](https://github.com/paytrail/paytrail-for-adobe-commerce/wiki/Recurring-Payments) to set it up.

## Refunds
This payment module supports online refunds.

Steps:
1. Navigate to __Sales -> Orders__ and select the order you need to fully or partially refund
2. Select Invoices from Order View side bar
3. Select the invoice
4. Select Credit Memo
5. Define the items you want to refund and optionally define an adjustment fee
6. Click Refund

## Canceled order payment email notification
If the customer closes the browser window right after completing the payment BUT before returning to the store, Adobe Commerce is left with a “Pending payment” status for the order. This status has a timeout, so if the payment confirmation does not arrive within 8 hours of the purchase, Adobe Commerce automatically cancels the order. Paytrail informs Adobe Commerce of a payment that has gone through, but it may take over 8 hours.

When the confirmation is finally made, Adobe Commerce registers the transaction to the order and changes the order status to Processing. But since the stock may have changed in the interim, the items are still cancelled. The merchant will receive an email informing about the payment that has gone through, but they have to manually go to said order, make sure the items are still available, and click “Restore order” to be able to ship it.

__Adjust the timeout__<br/>
The timeout period of 8 hours can be adjusted in Adobe Commerce configuration. A longer period may allow for Paytrail to confirm the order before it gets canceled, but it also reserves the stock for that exact time.
1. Go to __Stores -> Configuration -> Sales -> Sales -> Orders Cron Settings__
2. Adjust the __Pending Payment Order Lifetime (minutes)__ value to your liking.

## Order status
__Pending Payment__<br/>
Assigned to an order when customer is redirected to the payment provider of their choosing.

__Pending Paytrail Payment Service__<br/>
Assigned to an order if Paytrail for Adobe Commerce is still waiting for a confirmation of payment. Applies to invoices, such as Collector.

__Processing__<br/>
Assigned to an order once payment is completed and items are ready for shipping.

__Canceled__<br/>
Assigned to an order if Pending Payment status has been active for over 8 hours.

Available statuses:
- Processing
- Suspected Fraud
- Pending Payment
- Pending Paytrail Payment Service
- Payment Review
- Pending
- On Hold
- Complete
- Closed
- Canceled

## Multiple stores
If you have multiple stores, you can set up the payment module differently depending on the selected store. In configuration settings, there is a selection for Store View.

By changing the Store View, you can define different settings for each store within the Adobe Commerce instance.

## Rounding problems with certain providers (Collector)

In some cases, this module might send a so-called "rounding-row" item in the order data, which might result in an error if this value is negative (this has been observed with Collector payment method). This is related to how Adobe Commerce calculates and rounds taxes and how this module compensates for possible mismatches between the total and sum of individual items.

There are three algorithms for tax calculation in Adobe Commerce which can be set in __Stores -> Configuration -> Sales -> Tax -> Tax Calculation Method Based On__
- Unit Price based
- Row Total based
- Total based

If the described error occurs when the calculation algorithm is Total based, changing it to Unit Price based might result in tax calculation with no mismatches. 

__Note:__ Changing the setting does not mean that the Unit Price based algorithm is better than Total or Row Total based, all three can have rounding issues in certain situations that can be resolved by choosing one of the other algorithms. The algorithms end up with the same calculations majority of the time.
